Introduction:
    This program implements a Go-Back-N protocol, which could be used to transfer a text file from one host to another
    across an unreliable network. The protocol should be able to handle network errors such as packet loss and
    duplicate packets.

Compilation:
    To run this program, the .java files needs to be first compiled using make

Execution:
    1. Run nEmulator: nEmulator-linux386 9991 <host2> 9994 9993 <host3> 9994 1 0.2 0
    2: Run receiver: java receiver <host1> 9993 9994 <output file>
    3: Run sender: java sender <host1> 9991 9992 <input file>

    Three log files are generated:
        1) seqnum.log: record the sequence number of all packets sent
        2) ack.log: record the sequence numbers of all the ACK packets that the sender receives during the entire
                    period of transmission
        3) arrival.log: record the sequence numbers of all the data packets that the receiver receives during the
                    entire period of transmission

Environment:
    The program is built and tested on three different machines in the student environment:
    	1) Run nEmulator on host ubuntu1604-002
        2) Run sender on host ubuntu1604-004
        3) Run receiver on host ubuntu1604-006
